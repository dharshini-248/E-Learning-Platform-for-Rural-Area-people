## About The Project
Nowadays everyone is aware of using technology like mobile phones, laptops, tablets,etc.
Development in technology has benefited a lot of people.
In rural areas many people are facing struggles in the education facilities. 
To overcome these issues we have introduced the idea of an E-Learning platform with 24 hours live support features. This results in cost effective learning. 
We proposed the idea of creating a website in which users could learn everything as per government issued syllabus and the voice assistant is also provided to explain the content present inside their academics.
Online E- books are also present which will help to learn in a detailed manner.
In addition to this, doing exams in online options along with a ranking system according to class vice  is also provided.
